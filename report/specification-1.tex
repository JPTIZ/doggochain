    \section{Idea}

    The Doggochain project is a game in which players may own and pet monsters,
    which will have their own \textit{stats} (values that characterize monsters
    with respect to their strength or vitality, for example), and interact with
    wild and other players' monsters, including collect, pet, feed, train and
    even trade.

    \section{Motivation}

    The idea comes from CryptoKitties, a game where players can breed cat-like
    creatures and sell them in exchange for Ethereum. The problem is that the
    game doesn't explore more common games' features apart from some creatures
    being rare.

    \section{Justification}

    Since our group was looking for some ludic, non-currency related
    blockchain-based smart contract system, we decided then to create a more
    featureful monster game focusing in being an actual game with richer
    features.

    The use of Blockchain and Smart Contracts, aside being previously required
    for this project, are technologies currently being explored, but most
    usages aims for currency and just a few aims for games, leaving room for
    this work to explore and later report its results.

    \section{Requirements}

    \subsection{Functional}

    The system must:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Allow users to register themselves as players;
        \item Allow players to find, catch and own a \st{Pokémon} monster;
        \item Allow players to trade monsters between themselves if they aggree
              so;
        \item Allow players to train and evolve their monsters;
        \item Allow players to challenge each other with their monsters;
        \item Allow players to bet on which monster will win in a challenge.
        \item Allow players to set their monsters to \st{kill} friendly defeat
              wild monsters for experience points;
        \item Allow players to breed their monsters in order to \textit{mine}
              for new (and hopefully better) monsters;
        \item Allow users to know a monster's stats;
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Non-functional}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Monsters will evolve (increase their stats) once they reach a
              certain value of experience points (which will also increase upon
              evolving);
        \item Challenges' results must sound fair (according to later decided
              criteria from this project's authors);
        \item Trading must be done offering monster (and/or money) for monster
              (and/or money).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{document}
